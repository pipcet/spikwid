# First run on-boarding flow

First Run flow describes the entire experience users have after Firefox has successfully been installed up until the first instance of new tab is shown. 
First run help onboard new users by showing relevant messaging on about:welcome and about:newtab using triplets. 

### First Run Multistage
A full-page multistep experience that shows up on first run since Fx80 with browser.aboutwelcome.enabled pref as true.

Setting browser.aboutwelcome.enabled to false make first run looks like about:newtab and hides about:welcome
