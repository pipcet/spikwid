/**
 * The format allows for some compression compared with having fixed
 * length arrays for each value type and some indication of whether
 * a value is present.  This is because not all values are present on
 * a given platform, and because there is also substantial repetition
 * of specific values.
 *
 * Each of ints, floats, colors, and fonts is an array that stores the
 * unique values that occur in the LookAndFeel.  intMap, floatMap,
 * colorMap, and fontMap map from value IDs (LookAndFeel::IntID, etc.)
 * to indexes into the value arrays.  The map arrays are of fixed
 * length, determined by the maximum ID value.  If a value for a
 * particular ID is not present, the entry in the map is set to -1.
 *
 * (Note that fontMap is different from the others since it maps from a
 * LookAndFeel::FontID value minus 1, as 1 is the minimum value of that
 * enum.)
