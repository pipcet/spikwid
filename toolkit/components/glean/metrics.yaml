# This file defines the metrics that are recorded by the Glean SDK. They are
# automatically converted to platform-specific code at build time using the
# `glean_parser` PyPI package.

# This file is presently for Internal FOG Use Only.
# You should not add metrics here until probably about January of 2021.
# If you're looking for the metrics.yaml for Geckoveiw Streaming Telemetry,
# you can find that one in toolkit/components/telemetry/geckoview/streaming.
