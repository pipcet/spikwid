# Preferences

## User Preferences

`datareporting.healthreport.uploadEnabled`

This determines whether the Glean SDK is enabled.
It can be controlled by users via `about:preferences#privacy`.
If this is set to false from true, we send a
["deletion-request" ping](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/deletion_request.html)
and no data collections will be persisted or reported from that point.

## Test-only Preferences

`telemetry.fog.temporary_and_just_for_testing.data_path`

This controls the data path Glean is initialized with (`nightly` only).
It is intended for manual testing only. It will be removed once FOG gets a fixed data path.
By default it is not set. Change requires restart.

`telemetry.fog.test.localhost_port`

If set to a value `port` which is greater than 0, pings will be sent to
`http://localhost:port` instead of `https://incoming.telemetry.mozilla.org`.
Defaults to 0.
