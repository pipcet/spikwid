// [SMDOC] CacheIR Health Rating
//
// The goal of CacheIR health rating is to make the costlier
// CacheIR stubs more apparent and easier to diagnose.
// This is done by using the scores assigned to different CacheIROps in
// CacheIROps.yaml (see the description of cost_estimate in the
// aforementioned file for how these scores are determined), summing
// the score of each op generated for a particular stub together, and displaying
// this score for each stub in a CacheIR chain. The higher the total stub score
// the more expensive the stub is.
//
// To see the CacheIR health rating for a script, simply call the
// rateMyCacheIR() shell function. This function takes either a particular
// function as a parameter and then prints the health of the CacheIR generated
// for the script associated with that function, or if you call rateMyCacheIR()
// without any parameters it will take the topmost script and rate that.
//

 public:
  // Health of an individual stub.

  // Health of all the stubs in an individual CacheIR Entry.
