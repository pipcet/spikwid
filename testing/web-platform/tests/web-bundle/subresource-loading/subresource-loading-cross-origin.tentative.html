       This wpt should run on an origin which is different than https://web-platform.test:8444/,
       from where cross-orign WebBundles are served.

       This test uses the two cross-origin WebBundles:

       1. https://web-platform.test:8444/web-bundle/resources/wbn/cors/cross-origin.wbn,
          which is served with an Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header.
       2. http://web-platform.test:8444/web-bundle/resources/wbn/subreource.wbn,
          which is served *without* an Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header.

      `cross-origin.wbn` includes two subresources:
       a. `resource.cors.json`, which includes an Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header.
       b. `resource.no-cors.json`, which doesn't include an Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header.
