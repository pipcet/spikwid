<title>CSS Basic User Interface Test: -webkit-appearance: button</title>

<!--
  Test marked as tentative since although css-ui says "The element is rendered
  with the look and feel of a push button, similar to the appearance: auto
  rendering of the [HTML] button element.", there is no requirement that the
  look and feel of a push button is different from that of a drop-down select.
