# Create previews for pull requests on https://wptpr.live
#
# Mirroring pull requests to wptpr.live requires write access to the WPT GitHub
# repository. This means that we cannot run any code from the pull request in
# doing so, to defend against attacks from malicious pull requests. As such,
# this workflow uses the 'pull_request_target' event which runs in the context
# of the base repository and thus doesn't run code from the pull request. Any
# code run in this workflow should NOT checkout or trust code from the pull
# request.
#
# Note that in pull_request_target the GITHUB token is read/write.
